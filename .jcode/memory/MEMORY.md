# CipherOcto Memory

## Project Overview

- **Protocol** for autonomous intelligence collaboration (private AI, local infra, hybrid blockchain)
- **Ocean Stack**: 🐙 Assistant → Agent Orchestrator → 🦑 Secure Execution → 🪼 Hybrid Network
- **Branch Strategy**: trunk-based (main/next/feat/*/agent/*/research/*/hotfix/*)

## Current Focus

- RFC-0104: Deterministic Floating-Point (DFP) implementation
- quota-router-cli: Rust CLI for AI API quotas with HTTPS proxy

## Architecture

- **Determinism**: Class A (Protocol), Class B (Off-Chain), Class C (Probabilistic)

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Git: Never push without authorization** — commits OK, push requires user permission
2. **Always solve ALL RFC issues** — no deferrals, fix now or formal rebuttal only
3. **Cargo fmt before commit** — run `cargo fmt -- --check` before every commit
4. **Mode Gate ≠ Interface** — HTTP proxy AND Python SDK exist in ALL modes (litellm/any-llm/full)
5. **RFC references by number only** — no version pins, no status (e.g., RFC-0917 not RFC-0917 v2.35)
6. **docs/reviews/ are scratchpads** — NEVER committed to git

## BLUEPRINT Governance

### The 4 Layers (never mix)
| Layer | Question | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Research | CAN WE? | Feasibility |
| Use Cases | WHY? | Intent/Narrative |
| RFCs | WHAT? | Protocol Design |
| Missions | HOW? | Execution |

### Canonical Flow
`Idea → Research → Use Case → RFC → Mission → Agent Claims → Implementation → Merge → Protocol Evolution`

### RFC Lifecycle
`Planned → Draft → Review (7+ days) → Accepted → Final`

### Mission Rules
- REQUIRE an Accepted RFC — no RFC = no Mission
- 14-day claim timeout, 7-day PR review timeout
- Use `git mv` for status updates (preserves rename history)

### RFC Status Update Process

When updating RFC status (e.g., Draft → Accepted):

1. **Verify content first** — read both files, confirm headers/sections correct
2. **Use `git mv`** — track rename so git sees R100, not A+D
3. **Update Status header via sed** — `sed -i 's/Draft (/Accepted (/'`
4. **Stage and verify separately** — `git diff --cached --name-status` should show R100

```bash
# Verify rename tracked:
git diff --cached --name-status  # Should show R100

# Verify sections after move:
grep "^### Section:" accepted/file.md
```

**Content Swap Risk:** When moving multiple RFCs, avoid file-swapping operations.

### Human vs Agent
- Humans: Create Use Cases, Accept RFCs, Merge PRs
- Agents: Claim Missions, Implement RFCs, Write Tests
- Agents CANNOT initiate RFCs or create Use Cases
