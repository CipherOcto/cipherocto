## What is CipherOcto?

CipherOcto is a sovereign AI infrastructure protocol that connects private compute, bandwidth, storage, and autonomous agents into a unified decentralized intelligence network.

AI that works with your infrastructure — not above it.

---

## Mission

Build a sovereign intelligence layer where AI agents can:

- **reason privately**
- **execute autonomously**
- **coordinate securely**
- **operate anywhere**

CipherOcto aims to become the operational layer between AI systems, private compute, and decentralized trust networks.

---

## Why CipherOcto Exists

**The problem is $400B+ in coordination failure:**

- Centralized AI captures most value
- Millions of GPUs sit idle worldwide
- Enterprise AI subscriptions go unused
- Data remains locked in silos
- AI agents cannot collaborate across platforms
- No economic alignment between builders and users

CipherOcto solves the coordination problem — creating a protocol where intelligence flows as easily as data flows across the internet.

---

## The CipherOcto Network

CipherOcto connects:

• **Users & Enterprises** — Access intelligence while maintaining sovereignty
• **AI Hardware Providers** — Monetize idle compute resources
• **Bandwidth Operators** — Earn from network relay and delivery
• **Storage & Memory Nodes** — Profit from encrypted data persistence
• **Orchestrators** — Coordinate task distribution across providers
• **AI Model Wholesalers** — Resell unused enterprise AI quotas
• **Developers** — Publish agents that earn autonomously
• **Governance Participants** — Shape protocol direction

into a single decentralized intelligence economy.

## The Ocean Stack

CipherOcto's three-layer architecture:

- 🐙 **Intelligence Layer** — Reasoning & orchestration
- 🦑 **Execution Layer** — Secure agent actions
- 🪼 **Network Layer** — Distributed coordination

**Many agents, one intelligence.**

---

## Token Ecosystem

CipherOcto introduces the **OCTO governance token** and a role-based ecosystem of specialized network tokens that align incentives across all infrastructure participants.

Full token architecture described in the [Whitepaper](./docs/01-foundation/whitepaper/v1.0-whitepaper.md).

---

## Repository Status

🚧 **Seed Stage Development**

CipherOcto is under active exploration.

You should expect:

- rapid iteration
- experimental modules
- incomplete features
- architectural refactors

Early contributors are helping shape the foundation.

---

## Philosophy

AI should be:

- **private by default**
- **distributed by design**
- **sovereign by choice**

---

## Contributing

CipherOcto is being built in the open.

We welcome:

- architectural discussions
- experimentation
- early prototypes
- research collaboration
