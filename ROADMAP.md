**Economic Outcome:**
- Compute marketplace operational
- Token transfers happening
- Providers earning from participation
- Network effects accelerating

---

## Phase 4 — Market Layer

**Status:** Planned

**Focus:** Agent marketplace and economic activity

**Milestones:**

- Agents hiring agents autonomously
- Data classification economy active
- Reputation routing operational
- Token swap mechanisms live

**Economic Outcome:**
- Agents earning autonomously
- Composable agent patterns emerging
- Data markets forming
- Network effects compounding

---

## Phase 5 — Governance Activation

**Status:** Planned

**Focus:** Decentralized control and ecosystem ownership

**Milestones:**
- DAO governance deployment
- Bicameral system operational
- Protocol upgrade mechanism
- Treasury management active
- Community decision-making

**Economic Outcome:**
- OCTO token holders governing
- Contribution Council formed
- Protocol upgrades through governance
- Ecosystem owns its future

---

## Phase 6 — Self-Sustaining Economy

**Status:** Future vision

**Focus:** Network growth without centralized control

**Characteristics:**
- Sufficient contributors for continuous development
- Diverse provider ecosystem ensuring resilience
- Agent marketplace with thousands of specialized services
- Governance operating independently of founders
- Economic growth attracting new participants organically

**Success Metric:**
> The network continues growing even if the founding team disappears.

## How Progress Happens

**CipherOcto is not built by a company. It is grown by a community.**

Progress follows this sequence:

```
1. Documentation → Understanding spreads
2. Builder activation → Contributors arrive
3. Prototype network → Early usage emerges
4. Provider onboarding → Infrastructure grows
5. Market layer → Economic activity begins
6. Governance activation → Community takes over
7. Self-sustaining → Network effects compound
```

Each phase enables the next. Each phase depends on community participation.

---

## Current Focus: Phase 1

**We are here: Builder Activation**

The most critical window for early contributors.

**Why Phase 1 matters:**
- Categories are undefined
- Reputation scores are being established
- Protocol patterns are being set
- First movers gain lasting advantages

**How to participate:**
- → [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md) — Choose your path
- → [missions/](missions/) — Pick a mission
- → [ECOSYSTEM.md](ECOSYSTEM.md) — See what's happening

## Progress Indicators

**Track ecosystem growth:**

| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4+ |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Active Contributors | 0-100 | 100-500 | 500-5K | 5K+ |
| Agent Prototypes | 0-10 | 10-50 | 50-500 | 500+ |
| Providers | 0 | 1-10 | 10-100 | 100+ |
| Daily Transactions | 0 | Testnet | Low | High |
| Governance | Design | Design | Testing | Active |

**Current:** Phase 1 beginning — builder recruitment active.

---

## Shaping the Future

**The timeline above is not a schedule. It's a dependency graph.**

Phase 2 begins when Phase 1 generates sufficient builders.
Phase 3 begins when Phase 2 has working prototypes.
Phase 4 begins when Phase 3 has infrastructure providers.

**Progress accelerates when more people participate.**

---

## Your Role in the Roadmap

**You don't watch the roadmap happen. You make it happen.**

If you build an agent, you advance Phase 1.
If you run a provider node, you enable Phase 3.
If you design governance, you shape Phase 5.

**The roadmap is the history of what builders create.**
