## Overview

CipherOcto's growth depends on strategic partnerships across the AI, blockchain, and enterprise landscapes. This document outlines our partnership framework, target categories, and collaboration models.

## Partnership Philosophy

> **We build infrastructure, not walled gardens.**

Partnerships should:
1. **Expand ecosystem value** — Create net-new opportunities
2. **Maintain decentralization** — No central points of control
3. **Benefit all participants** — Mutual value creation
4. **Preserve user sovereignty** — No lock-in or extraction
