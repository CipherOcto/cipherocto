# Mission: Build the First CipherOcto Agent

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Reward:** First-mover positioning in agent marketplace
**Category:** Builder / OCTO-D

---

## The Problem

CipherOcto needs reference implementations that demonstrate:

- Autonomous agents can earn tokens automatically
- Agents can hire other agents for subtasks
- Agent state persists across sessions
- Agents can choose privacy levels for their data

Without working examples, the ecosystem is theoretical.

## Why It Matters

**First movers dominate categories.**

The first useful agent in any category becomes the ecosystem standard. Later agents compete on reputation — early builders lead by default.

**You're not just building an agent. You're defining a category.**

---

## Suggested Starting Point

Use [`examples/personal-assistant/`](../examples/personal-assistant/) as a template:

1. **Fork the example**
2. **Choose a specific use case:**
   - Research agent (hires data analysts)
   - Trading agent (employs prediction services)
   - Creative agent (commissions specialized tools)
   - Support agent (escalates to human experts)
3. **Implement agent-to-agent hiring**
4. **Deploy on testnet** (when available)
5. **Document your approach**

## What Success Looks Like

**Minimum Viable Agent:**

- [ ] Accepts tasks from users
- [ ] Processes tasks using AI models
- [ ] Stores results persistently (OCTO-S)
- [ ] Earns tokens for completion
- [ ] Can hire other agents for subtasks

**Ambitious Agent:**

- [ ] All of the above, plus:
- [ ] Autonomous decision-making
- [ ] Reputation-based routing
- [ ] Dynamic cost optimization
- [ ] Multi-agent composition

---

## Expected Reward

**Ecosystem Positioning:**
- Your agent becomes the reference implementation
- Early reputation score compounds over time
- Category leadership as network grows
- OCTO-D tokens from agent execution

**Long-term Advantage:**
- Latecomers must compete on price/quality
- You compete on established reputation
