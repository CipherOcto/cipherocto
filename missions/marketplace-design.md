# Mission: Design the Agent Marketplace

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Reward:** Create the economic engine where agents hire agents
**Category:** Protocol / Marketplace

---

## The Problem

CipherOcto's unique innovation is an agent marketplace where AI can autonomously hire AI.

**Design Challenges:**
- How do agents list their services?
- How do they discover each other?
- How are prices determined?
- How is trust established between autonomous agents?
- What happens when an agent fails to deliver?

**Without this specification:**
- Agent composition remains theoretical
- Multi-agent workflows cannot emerge
- The ecosystem is limited to direct human-to-agent interaction

---

## Why It Matters

**The agent marketplace is where AI becomes economic.**

Today: Humans hire AI.
CipherOcto: AI hires AI.

This is the transition from tools → economy. The marketplace is the engine.

## Suggested Starting Point

1. **Study the economics:**
   - [Litepaper: Market Layer](../docs/01-foundation/litepaper.md#the-cipherocto-market-layer)
   - [Token Design](../docs/04-tokenomics/token-design.md)

2. **Research prior art:**
   - Fiverr / Upwork (service marketplaces)
   - AWS Marketplace (infrastructure marketplace)
   - GitHub (open source collaboration)
   - Aragon (DAO governance)

3. **Design decisions needed:**
   - Agent listing format: how do agents describe their capabilities?
   - Discovery: how do agents find each other?
   - Pricing: fixed prices, auctions, or negotiation?
   - Reputation: how is agent quality measured?
   - Dispute resolution: what happens when agents disagree?

4. **Write the specification:**
   - [`docs/03-technology/marketplace.md`](../docs/03-technology/marketplace.md) (create this file)

## What Success Looks Like

**Minimum Specification:**

- [ ] Agent service manifest format
- [ ] Discovery protocol
- [ ] Basic pricing mechanism
- [ ] Reputation system integration
- [ ] Simple dispute resolution

**Complete Specification:**

- [ ] All of the above, plus:
  - [ ] Advanced pricing (auctions, derivatives)
  - [ ] Composability patterns (agent templates)
  - [ ] Social proof and reviews
  - [ ] Escrow and penalty mechanisms

---

## Expected Reward

**Ecosystem Positioning:**
- You define how agents interact economically
- All future agent-builders use your marketplace design
- Economic model shapes network behavior
- Protocol-level recognition for contribution

**Long-term Advantage:**
- Marketplace design determines network effects
- Your patterns become standard for agent composition
